# workspace_allocation v1.0

### This program will help allocate seats to employees in each workspace and return the number of employees yet to allocated seats.
### Can be improved further by adding different sorts of elements and aim to keep improving it.

Note - This program is being run with the Greedy algorithm. I have only scratched the surface and have next-to-nothing knowledge about it.
